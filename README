Contains the code used to generate our paper "The Phenomenon of Correlated Representations in Contrastive Learning".
To limit the size, we downscaled our datasets, thus the datasets in datas/ only contain 5 samples each, instead of >1000.


The most important code is found in main.py, which can be called to train a specific model and loss task.
These tasks are defined in the tasks.py file, which can be executed to list all available tasks.
The models are defined in the basemodel.py file, and the loss functions are defined in the losses.py file.

After training, models are evaluated using calc_accuracy from basemodel.py and metrics from collapse.py. The results are stored under results in the json format.

For the final ensemble experiments, grow.py and ensemble.py are used (to combine multiple model representations, and to evaluate parts of this bigger representation).

Finally, this code contains multiple plotting scripts (plot_*), each creating a different plot used in the paper.

Other codes are only used for small very specific changes or to ignore RAM limitations.
